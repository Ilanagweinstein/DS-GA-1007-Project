Fall 2019 DS-GA-1007 Project

This project focuses on the elements that comprise a critically acclaimed film as defined by IMDbâ€™s Top 250 Movie list. We approach this problem using web scraping and web-based automation tools in Python. Our results show that this is an effective and efficient way to collect data which visualizations can be made from to draw conclusions.
